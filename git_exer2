What are the benefits of commits?
Is there another way to verify a commit was created?

Commits in Git allow for the tracking of changes made to a project over time. By committing changes, users can save their progress, track the history of a project, and easily revert to earlier versions if necessary. Commits also enable collaboration, as multiple users can work on the same project and merge their changes together.

Another way to verify that a commit was created is to look at the commit's hash, which is a unique identifier generated by Git. The hash is generated based on the contents of the commit, so if the contents of the commit are altered, the hash will also change. Therefore, the hash serves as a way to verify that the commit has not been tampered with. Additionally, digital signature can be used to sign a commit, which is another way to verify the authenticity of a commit
