After you complete the exercise
Answer the following:

What is the reason for squashing commits?
Is it possible to squash more than 2 commits?

Ans:
===

First change branch fro master to dev

# git switch dev

# git branch	(to validate our branch change)

Now, change our editor as Vi unless it picks Nano Editor in future:

# git config --global core.editor vi

Now, doing our tasks:

# touch git_exer3

# echo "Mario" > git_exer3

# git commit -a -m "Initial commit"

# echo "Mario & Luigi" > git_exer3

# git commit -a -m git_exer3

# git rebase -i HEAD~2 (this will open Vi file to edit, change the second commit's 'pick' to 'squash' and save the file.
A new editor will open where you can edit the commit message to summarize the changes made in both commits)

# :wq!

Now another file opens and shows Last two commit messgaes and merged messages.

# The last two commits will now be squashed into one new commit with the updated commit message 

# wq!

Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/dev.

# git push origin dev  (This will pushes our files to github)
