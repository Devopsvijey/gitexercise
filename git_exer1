In step1; we have done

1. create a new repo in your github
2. come to VM and config git by the followings;
   a. git config --global user.name "Devopsvijey"
   b. git config --global user.email "kkvijeyabhaskaran@gmail.com"
   c. git config --global -l
3. ssh-keygen (copy our ssh public key to github key area) 
4. git clone "git@github.com:Devopsvijey/gitexercise.git"
5. git init
   touch devopsexercise
6. git add
7. git commit -m "commit message"
8. git push -u origin master


In step 2:

1. git branch dev
2. git checkout dev
3. vi devopsexercise (now modifing the things) esc:wq!
4. git add devopsexercise
5. git commit -m "new message" (This will create a commit hash below) 
6. git branch --contains <copy the commit hash generated>
7. git push -u origin dev

Why branches are useful? Give an example of one real-world scenario for using branches.

Answer:

Allow multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other.

Provide a way to test new features or bug fixes in isolation.

Make it easy to roll back to a previous version of the code, in case something goes wrong.

Provide a way to keep development, staging and production code separate.

in general, make the development process more organized, efficient and less risky.

Example:

In a software devlopment project, The main branch, often referred to as the "master" branch, contains the production-ready code. 
Developers can create separate branches for new features or bug fixes they are working on. 
This allows them to work independently of each other without risking conflicts or breaking the main branch. 
Once a developer has finished working on a feature or fix, they can submit a pull request to have their changes reviewed and merged into the main branch.
